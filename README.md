## Introduction Statement
I'm Adam McKnight. Currently , I'm searching for a full-time Software or Web Development job! I think I can effectively do the job. Here's Why...

My passion for computers started when I was a little kid, and grew from there. In 2013 I started volunteering at my Church recording and editing videos, which over the years led to designing graphics. This urge to be creative then led to me taking a pivotal step, by attending Butler Tech, D. Russel Lee during my Junior and Senior years of High School. In 2016, I graduated with both High School Credentials and a Certificate of Digital Media.

After graduating High School I took the normal route of applying for colleges. Landing on my local community college as the best option. While attending my first year in 2017, I was introduced to Web Development. Shortly thereafter, I was “hooked”.

Today, I’m actively seeking a full-time Software Engineering position. Below are my Qualifications, Projects I've worked on, and the Skills I've aquired.
